# Task-6-Create-a-Strong-Password-and-Evaluate-Its-Strength.
&nbsp;To Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools. And also to safeguard the valuable data by basic precaution which is to avoid credential theft. 

**1. Objective**
   
&nbsp;To understand the factors that make a password strong, test different passwords using an online password strength checker, and learn best practices for password creation and security.

**2. Tools Used**
   
Website: Password Meter.com (Free online password strength checker)

Evaluation Criteria: Strength score, complexity feedback, and recommendations from the tool.

**3. Method**
   
1.Created 5 passwords with varying complexity:

  - Short/simple

  - Medium complexity

  - Strong with symbols and mixed case

  - Long passphrase

  - Random generated secure password

2.Tested each password on PasswordMeter.

3.Recorded scores and feedback.

4.Analyzed results to determine best practices.

**4. Results**

| Test No. | Password Type\*                           | Strength Level | Estimated Time to Crack | Key Characteristics                                  | Difference Compared to Others                          |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1        | Simple (lowercase only)                   | Weak           | Few seconds             | Very short, only lowercase letters or simple numbers | Weakest; lacks length, symbols, and variety            |
| 2        | Lowercase + numbers                       | Medium         | Minutes                 | Slightly longer, includes numbers                    | Better than Test 1, but still predictable              |
| 3        | Uppercase + lowercase + numbers           | Strong         | Hours                   | Mixed case and numbers, moderate length              | More secure than 1 & 2, still missing symbols          |
| 4        | Uppercase + lowercase + numbers + symbols | Very Strong    | Years                   | Complex with multiple character types                | Significantly stronger; symbols add big security boost |
| 5        | Long + mixed case + numbers + symbols     | Excellent      | Centuries               | 12+ characters, fully random, all character types    | Strongest; ideal password with length and randomness   |

**5. Best Practices Learned**
   
- Use at least 12 characters; longer is always better.

Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

Avoid dictionary words or predictable sequences.

Use passphrases (e.g., “Tiger$Plays@Guitar”) for easier recall with high security.

Change passwords regularly and never reuse across accounts.

Consider using a password manager for strong random passwords.

**6. Common Password Attacks**

Brute Force Attack: Tries all possible combinations until correct; longer/more complex passwords take much longer to crack.

Dictionary Attack: Uses lists of common passwords or words; easily defeats simple words like “password” or “welcome123”.

Phishing: Tricks user into revealing password; not prevented by complexity but by awareness.

Credential Stuffing: Using leaked credentials from one service to try on another; avoid by not reusing passwords.

**7. How Complexity Affects Security**

Short, simple passwords can be cracked in seconds by brute force.

Adding mixed case, numbers, and symbols exponentially increases cracking time.

Long passphrases can be more secure and easier to remember than short random strings.

**8. Conclusion**

Testing different passwords showed that length and variety of character types greatly improve security. The best protection comes from using unique, long, and complex passwords combined with safe online practices.
